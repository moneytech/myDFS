# MyDFS

A simple distribuited file system, made in the context of the exam of the Operating System Progamming course I did back in 2015.

Made in C, developed for Linux and ported to MacOS and Windows.

Sadly all the documentation and the project details are in Italian. Sorry!

You can find the project details [here](specs.md), and my writeup it's [here](MyDistributedFileSystem.pdf).
